Orbit is a collection of web components for creating smooth, accessible animations and interactive UI elements.

## Core Principles

- **Accessibility First**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines.
- **Performance Focused**: Optimized for smooth performance, even on mobile devices.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use with vanilla JavaScript or any framework with our React wrappers.
- **Declarative API**: Simple, intuitive interfaces for complex animations.

## Accessibility

All Orbit components respect the user's motion preferences and provide accessible alternatives. We use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and allow users to override their preferences via the `Motion Toggle` component.

## Getting Started

To get started with Orbit, follow our [Installation guide](/docs/installation--docs).
